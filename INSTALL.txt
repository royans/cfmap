Getting Started - How to setup your own cfmap cluster

Requirements
	Java 1.6
	Jakarta Ant
	Maven (mvn) if you need to install Jetty webserver, (recommended)
	Cfmap comes with scripts to start on Linux, but you should be able to run it on pretty much any platform.
	The standard install comes bundled with cassandra binaries, but you can use your own cluster if you already have one.
	It also comes with Jetty webserver which again is optional if you want to use your own webserver.

Download Source
	svn checkout https://cfmap.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ cfmap

Build Source
	Build the package using ant.
		cd cfmap/build
		ant

	Copy the tarball to the desired location and untar it.

Start/Stop
	Start
		bin/startup.sh
	Stop
		bin/shutdown.sh

Configuring cfmap
	cfmap.properties can be tweaked to do few interesting things. The most important of which is the fact that you would probably like to run cfmap as a cluster across multiple nodes.

	You can set "cassandra_servers" to any number of servers. At the very least we recommend you to set this to an actual hostname or IP address where cfmap will be run. This information is used within cassandra configuration file as the seed address which all the cassandra servers will be contacting to discover the full cassandra network.
	cfmap_port is set to the port on which jetty listens on. Set it to whatever works for you.
